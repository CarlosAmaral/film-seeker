# Film Seeker Frontend

#### Context 

This ReactJS frontend consumes the Film Seeker Backend API that responds with data from  [OMDb API The Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com) to display a list of film names based on the user's search criteria. Additionally, this React application has a Redux store to handle the business logic and pass state from its store to the components, thus making them solely responsible for using data in the View. 

This React App project was generated through the Create-React-App scaffolding tool that's backed up by Facebook's development team and thus gathers the best programming practices when it comes down to creating and configuring a React application.
